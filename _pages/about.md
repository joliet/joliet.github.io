I'm currently a product manager and UX designer at Duke University leading a team in redesigning a middleware product.  My skills include product discovery, content strategy and UX writing, user research, Agile/Scrum product development, and Lean UX.

Prior to my current role, I worked as an application manager and service lead for Duke's open-source learning management system.  In that role, I worked extensively with the open source community to build their product.  This included serving as QA lead, facilitating a project to update to the product's style guide, and co-chairing the UX Working Group.

All of my professional experience and skills are listed on my [CV](/images/design/Tingen_Jolie_CV.pdf).

When I'm away from my keyboard, I like to bike, read, watch movies and play games with my husband and daughter.
