A few examples of UX workshops I've designed and conducted.

**Design Thinking**
I was asked to assist in leading a design thinking workshop for the 'Hack Your Eduction' Spring Breakthrough course in collaboration with two faculty and two other members of my team. Specifically, my role was provide guidance for ideation techniques and to help students design a usability test appropriate for their prototype.  A working knowledge of many techiques for ideation and testing was required as I wouldn't know the details of the project until I stepped into the classroom - ideas were rapidly evolving.

The students had chosen a project to promote the adoption of open educational resources which they hoped would make course materials more affordable and accessible should more faculty adopt them.  They had designed a series of promotional assets.  I suggested they test these materials in two ways - with a five-second test to validate the effectiveness of their messages, and with role playing to ensure their messages would resonate with faculty.

Questions asked in the 5-second usabiity test:

1. What do you remember from the page you just saw?
2. What do you think is the purpose of the page?
3. What was the most prominent element that you remember from the page?

For the role playing exercise, I used IDEO's Design Kit to share the description and steps of the activity.

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/148003889" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Pretty cool, huh?

We've packed this theme with powerful features to show off your work.

Why not put them to use on your new portfolio?
