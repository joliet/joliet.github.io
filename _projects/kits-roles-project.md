description: In this project, I conducted application and user research to learn how the team should design roles in the Kits product.

In 2019, I conducted usability testing for a new design and discovered that users were confused about role names and permissions in our product, Kits.  Kits is a middleware product that integrates with many other apps has two different types of 'kits' - one for learning and one for collaboration. The same set of roles were used for both types - instructor, assistant, and student.  Users did not associate these role with collaboration kits, nor were they able to translate these roles easily to roles in integrated apps.

Using what I learned through testing, I created a project plan to improve role naming.

**Problem**: Users don't associate existing role names with collaboration kits.

**Hypothesis**: Role names used in other collaboration tools are expected.

**Metric**: Users will select the correct role for collaborators based on permissions needed 85% of the time during the final round of usability testing.

The overall process would involve research of role names of integrated collaboration tools, more user research to understand users' mental models of roles names and permissions across tools, selection of new roles based on this research and more usability testing.


**Research**  -->  **Usability Test** --> **Prototype** --> **Usability Test** --> **Roll out**

Since many other tools are connected to Kits, I started with an evaluation of roles across all integrated tools.

To better understand users' mental models of roles and permissions associated with roles, I conducted a card sorting activity to learn how users would categorize roles across the application and with integrated tools.

**Outcome**

Through conducting a usability with new role names - Owner, Editor, and Viewer - we discovered that these roles were selected correctly by 90% of users based on the role's permissions in the kit.

These role names have been added to the product and we have not received any negative feedback in user interviews or support tickets related to the new roles.

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added â€“ galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.
